I'm currently an assistant professor at Artificial Intelligence Thrust, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I received my ph.D degree in Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in July, 2022. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree at Beijing Institute of Technology. 

In the recent five years, I have published many papers in the prestigious refereed conferences and journals, such as Nature Communications, TKDE, KDD, NeurIPS, WWW, etc. These works have been covered by authoritative medias such as China Daily and Guangming Net.
